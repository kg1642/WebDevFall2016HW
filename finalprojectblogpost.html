	<div>

<p>I will continue Midterm project[Visit Nepal] as my Final project. I will be adding more pages and more features. Pages and features that I will add are described below:<img src="img/VisitNepal.png"/></p>

<ol>
	<li><p>I will add KnowYourNepalBD Page. I already have a working prototype of it so I will just need to put it within the website and make some slight desing changes.</p></li>

<li><p>I will add another page where you can read the most popular tweets in the country in real time. </p></li>

<li><p>I will also add maps that shows places you can visit and activities you can do.</p></li>

<li><p>I will Use Boostrap, Javascript and other tools to make the desing better. </p></li>
</ol>
