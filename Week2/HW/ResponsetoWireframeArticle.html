        <h1>My Reponse to Wireframing Article</h1></header>
    <p>Whenever you have a problem, you are always tempted to sit down and start working on it right away. I was very restless before I started college. I would start working on the project as soon as I can without planning it properly first. It seemed okay at that time as the project I was working were simple and easy to do. As I progressed through college, it became more and more difficult. Slowly, I started a habit of planning it ahead and then sitting down to write the code. This technique helps me to anticipate how long will it take me to complete the work and also if I need something else which I do not have now. The article about wire framing completely aligns with my experience. Planning ahead will definitely save lots of time later on and it makes us prepared for the problems that might arise. </p>
