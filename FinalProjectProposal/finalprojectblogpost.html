    <h1><center>Final Project: Visit Nepal</h1>
    <div style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%; font-size:30px;">
        <p>I continued working on my Midterm project[Visit Nepal] for my Final project. I added more pages and more features. Pages and features that I will added described below:
        </p>
        <center><img src="homepage.png" style="width:60%; height:auto; border:1px solid black" /></center>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>I used boostrap so that the pages are more responsive. I also changed the how the nav bar works. Now, when you click on a certain destinations or activity it you scroll you to the div of that destination or activity and it reduces the brightnes of the image, increase its size and gives a brief intro about that destination or activity. It can be done from other pages as well. The same effect will take place if you hover over the images.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I added a Know Your Nepal Birthday Page. It also allows you to share the result in either Twitter or Facebook. I used twitter and facebook api, boostrap-date-picker for the maps and implemented the logic the change from English to Nepali date by coding in javascript</p>
            </li>
            <center><img src="knowyourBD.png" style="width:60%; height:auto; border:1px solid black" /></center>
            <li>
                <p>I also added the most popular tweets in the country in real time. I used the Twitter widget for it. </p>
            </li>
            <center><img src="twitter.png" style="width:60%; height:auto; border:1px solid black" /></center>
        </ul>
        <h1>Problems I Faced and How I solved them</h1>
        <ul>
        	<li><p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to scroll to certain div when a button is clicked. After a lot of googling I figured that out and a second problem arose. I also wanted to enlarge the image for just 5 seconds so that the user know which image is the one corresponds to that option they clicked. I could decrease the image to normal after 5 seconds but the effect of hover would not work.</p></li>
        	<center><img src="jquery.jpg" style="width:60%; height:auto; border:1px solid black" /></center>
        	<li><p>I could not change how FB and Twitter share button look. This is because both FB and Twitter wont update by js until next week. I tried changing the div size but it still did not work. We would have to wait till next week to have a perfectly sized buttons. </p></li><p>I struggled a lot trying to override some of the boostrap nav classes. Although, not a good practise, I used !important multiple times and even included css under style tag in html documents.<p></li> 
        	<li>
        </ul>
        <h1> Future Plans</h1>
        <p>To solve most of the problems above. I also wanted to add an animation of Nepali Flag. As there is lots of space in Nepal Talk page and Know your Nepali Birthday page I would have it somewhere there. Also adding more destination and activities and having a horizontal slider for them would be great.</p>
        <h1>Thank you</h1>
